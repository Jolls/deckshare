## [Unreleased]
### Added
- `.apkg` / `.colpkg` reader: package → intermediate representation, covering collection schemas 11 and 18+, the legacy and zstd containers, and content-addressed media ([#9](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/9))
- Synthetic `.apkg` fixtures built to `docs/apkg-format.md`, pending real Anki exports ([#9](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/9))
- Collection-member preference regression test: a package carrying both `collection.anki21` and a one-note `collection.anki2` downgrade stub must read the former ([#9](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/9))
- The reviewer and the write queue: one-request session start, synchronous local grading, a durable `localStorage` queue draining to an idempotent `POST /api/reviews/batch`, and the server-side `review_log` recompute path ([#13](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/13))
- `defaultFsrsParams()` — the `ts-fsrs` defaults a user schedules with before their first optimiser fit ([#13](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/13))

### Fixed
- `docs/apkg-format.md`: `cards.due` has three meanings discriminated by `queue`, not two by `type`, and `cards.odue` shadows it entirely for cards in a filtered deck; the negative-`ivl` seconds encoding also applies to `revlog`; schema-18 configs are protobuf; deck-name separators and field ordering differ per schema; the modern media index is protobuf ([#9](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/9))

### Security
- `.apkg` reading enforces archive ceilings (member count, per-member and total decompressed size) and checks a zstd frame's declared size before decompressing, so an uploaded package cannot exhaust memory ([#9](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/9))

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-07
### Added
- Full data model in Drizzle: content tables, `deck_access`, `user_card_state`, append-only `review_log`, `user_fsrs_params`, and content-addressed media ([#4](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/4))
- `studyDayStart()` / `studyDayEnd()` — per-user 04:00-local study-day boundary computed in SQL ([#4](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/4))
- Isomorphic `uuidv7()` for client-generated, time-ordered ids ([#4](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/4))

### Removed
- The scaffold's placeholder `task` table ([#4](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/4))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-07
### Added
- SvelteKit + TypeScript (strict) scaffold: ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, Playwright, Drizzle + PostgreSQL, CI ([#3](https://github.com/Jolls/enshu/issues/3))
